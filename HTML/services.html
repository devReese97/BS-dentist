        Taking good care of your teeth and gums is an important part of life. A beautiful smile not only looks good, but it is also an indicator of your overall health. Studies have shown that systemic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, are directly linked to oral health complications like periodontal (gum) disease. At Gary C Mangieri, DMD PLLC, our goal is to help you maintain excellent oral health and improve your overall quality of life. Our services include preventive, restorative, cosmetic, and emergency dentistry. If you are in need of any professional dental treatment, you have come to the right place!

            <h3 class="grey-head">Family Dentistry</h3>
            <p class="services-p-2">A large part of our practice involves family dentistry. We take great pride in treating every member of the family, from infants to grandparents! These treatments are often simple and straightforward, designed to prevent potential problems. A routine appointment typically consists of professional cleaning and check-up exam. We may also recommend an oral cancer screening for adults, and fluoride treatment for children. If we notice any instances of tooth decay or gum disease, you may need restorative treatment.

            <h3 class="grey-head">Restorative Dentistry</h3>
            <p class="services-p-2">Restorative dentistry is designed to fix any problems you may have with your teeth, gum tissues, jaw, and bone structure. We may recommend a dental filling to correct instances of minor or moderate decay. If the damage is substantial, you may need a dental crown. A dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that improves the function and aesthetics of the tooth. If the tooth is beyond saving, Dr. Gary Mangieri will perform a tooth extraction. Tooth loss is much more common then you may think. For this reason, we offer several replacement solutions, some of which include bridges, dental implants, and dentures.

            <h3 class="grey-head">Cosmetic Dentistry</h3>
            <p class="services-p-2">Cosmetic dentistry has grown significantly over the past few decades thanks to advancements in technology and technique. Cutting-edge equipment allows us to improve the size, shape, color, and overall appearance of an unsightly tooth. The cosmetic services we provide include teeth whitening, porcelain crowns, dental sealants, and dental veneers & bonding. Teeth whitening treatment is one of the most common procedures we perform due to its effectiveness. We may recommend a porcelain crown for both restorative and cosmetic purposes. The same is true for dental veneers. Both restorations are fabricated using porcelain because of its unmatched aesthetic value.
